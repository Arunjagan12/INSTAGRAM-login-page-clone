<h1><b>THIS IS A CLONE OF INSTAGRAM LOGIN PAGE CREATED USING HTML5 AND CSS3</b></h1>

<p>An Instagram login page clone using HTML and CSS involves replicating the design and layout of the official Instagram login page using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

The login page typically includes a form for users to enter their username and password, along with a "Forgot password" link and a "Sign up" link. The form has been styled using CSS to match the Instagram brand colors and fonts, as well as other design elements such as the Instagram logo and background image.</p>
